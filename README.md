Group project by: Emmanuel Asiedu and Priscilla Yartey.

Task 0: Write a function _printf that produces output according to a format string. It should handle conversion specifiers %c, %s, and %%.

Task 1: Extend the _printf function to handle conversion specifiers %d and %i, which print signed integers.

Task 2: Add support for a custom conversion specifier %b, which converts an unsigned integer argument to binary.

Task 3: Extend _printf to handle conversion specifiers %u, %o, %x, and %X, which print unsigned integers in decimal, octal, and hexadecimal format (lowercase and uppercase).

Task 4: Optimize the _printf function by using a local buffer of 1024 characters to minimize the number of calls to write.

Task 5: Handle the custom conversion specifier %S, which prints strings and represents non-printable characters (ASCII value less than 32 or greater than or equal to 127) as \x followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (uppercase).

Task 6: Handle the conversion specifier %p, which prints pointers in hexadecimal format.

Task 7: Add support for the flag characters +, space, and # for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 9: Handle the length modifiers l and h for non-custom conversion specifiers (d, i, u, o, x, X).

Task 10: Implement handling of the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 11: Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 12: Add support for the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 13: Implement handling of the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Task 14: Handle the custom conversion specifier %r, which prints the reversed string.

Task 15: Implement handling of the custom conversion specifier %R, which prints the string in ROT13 encoding.

Task 16: Ensure that all the above options work together seamlessly, allowing for multiple combinations of format specifiers.
